<p> Will smith is a very good actor and he is very inspirational. He is one of the main characters in Bad Boys and he plays an amazing roll in both of these movies. He has talent like no other and he is very famous for it.To me Will Smith is one of the funniest actors. He is in many great movies and he has a very good reputation. In the Men In Black series, he partners with Tommy Lee Jones who is another actor I like. They made four Men In Blacks and one of them released only last year. They are both still in the business and making a lot of money.

<p> Smith was born on September 25, 1968 in Philadelphia. He grew up in Western Philadelphia and he was raised Baptist. He has three children who he loves very much. He has been nominated for five Golden globe awards and two Academy Awards, and has four grammies under his belt. He is a very succesful actor, producer, and rapper.
